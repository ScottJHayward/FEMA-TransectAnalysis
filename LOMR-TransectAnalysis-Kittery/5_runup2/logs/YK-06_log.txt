    Depth, D = 25.85
    Period, T = 8.17
    Waveheight, H = 3.67
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*8.17*8.17/6.28 = 342.20
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 342.20/8.17 = 41.86 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/8.17 = 0.77
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.77*0.77*25.85/32.17 = 0.47
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 26.56
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(41.86/26.56) = 1.26
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 3.67/1.26 = 2.92
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 2.92 feet
