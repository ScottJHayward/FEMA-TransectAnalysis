    Depth, D = 36.64
    Period, T = 12.36
    Waveheight, H = 14.29
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*12.36*12.36/6.28 = 782.38
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 782.38/12.36 = 63.30 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/12.36 = 0.51
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.51*0.51*36.64/32.17 = 0.29
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 32.66
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(63.30/32.66) = 1.39
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 14.29/1.39 = 10.26
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 10.26 feet
