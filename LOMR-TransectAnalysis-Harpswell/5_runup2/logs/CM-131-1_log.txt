Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*3.12*3.12/6.28 = 49.99
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 49.99/3.12 = 16.00 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/3.12 = 2.01
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 2.01*2.01*25.79/32.17 = 3.24
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 15.94
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(16.00/15.94) = 1.00
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
