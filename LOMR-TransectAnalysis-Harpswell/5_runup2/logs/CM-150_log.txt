    Depth, D = 18.02
    Period, T = 11.52
    Waveheight, H = 4.57
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*11.52*11.52/6.28 = 679.03
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 679.03/11.52 = 58.97 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/11.52 = 0.55
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.55*0.55*18.02/32.17 = 0.17
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 23.41
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(58.97/23.41) = 1.59
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 4.57/1.59 = 2.88
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 2.88 feet
