    Depth, D = 15.53
    Period, T = 3.60
    Waveheight, H = 1.39
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*3.60*3.60/6.28 = 66.22
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 66.22/3.60 = 18.41 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/3.60 = 1.75
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 1.75*1.75*15.53/32.17 = 1.47
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 16.98
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(18.41/16.98) = 1.04
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 1.39/1.04 = 1.34
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 1.34 feet
