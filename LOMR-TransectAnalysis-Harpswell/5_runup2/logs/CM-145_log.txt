    Waveheight, H = 4.92
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*9.94*9.94/6.28 = 505.46
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 505.46/9.94 = 50.88 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/9.94 = 0.63
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.63*0.63*53.60/32.17 = 0.67
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 36.90
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(50.88/36.90) = 1.17
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 4.92/1.17 = 4.19
