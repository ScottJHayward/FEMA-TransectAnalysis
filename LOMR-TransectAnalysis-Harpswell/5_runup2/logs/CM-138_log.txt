    Depth, D = 52.12
    Period, T = 10.00
    Waveheight, H = 6.20
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*10.00*10.00/6.28 = 512.42
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 512.42/10.00 = 51.22 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/10.00 = 0.63
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.63*0.63*52.12/32.17 = 0.64
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 36.57
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(51.22/36.57) = 1.18
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 6.20/1.18 = 5.24
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 5.24 feet
