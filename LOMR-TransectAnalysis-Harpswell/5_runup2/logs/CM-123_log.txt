    Depth, D = 28.30
    Period, T = 4.38
    Waveheight, H = 2.42
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*4.38*4.38/6.28 = 98.45
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 98.45/4.38 = 22.45 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/4.38 = 1.43
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 1.43*1.43*28.30/32.17 = 1.81
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 21.47
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(22.45/21.47) = 1.02
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 2.42/1.02 = 2.36
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 2.36 feet
