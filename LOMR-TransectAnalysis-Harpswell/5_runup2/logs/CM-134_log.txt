    Depth, D = 29.23
    Period, T = 4.21
    Waveheight, H = 1.72
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*4.21*4.21/6.28 = 90.74
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 90.74/4.21 = 21.56 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/4.21 = 1.49
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 1.49*1.49*29.23/32.17 = 2.02
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 20.92
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(21.56/20.92) = 1.02
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 1.72/1.02 = 1.69
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 1.69 feet
