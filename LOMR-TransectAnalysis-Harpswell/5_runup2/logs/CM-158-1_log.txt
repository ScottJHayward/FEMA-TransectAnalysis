    Depth, D = 28.45
    Period, T = 2.29
    Waveheight, H = 1.10
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*2.29*2.29/6.28 = 26.97
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 26.97/2.29 = 11.75 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/2.29 = 2.74
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 2.74*2.74*28.45/32.17 = 6.63
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 11.75
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(11.75/11.75) = 1.00
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 1.10/1.00 = 1.10
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 1.10 feet
