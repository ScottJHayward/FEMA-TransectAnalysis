    Depth, D = 19.57
    Period, T = 11.45
    Waveheight, H = 2.94
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*11.45*11.45/6.28 = 671.69
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 671.69/11.45 = 58.65 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/11.45 = 0.55
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.55*0.55*19.57/32.17 = 0.18
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 24.32
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(58.65/24.32) = 1.55
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 2.94/1.55 = 1.89
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 1.89 feet
