    Depth, D = 51.90
    Period, T = 8.40
    Waveheight, H = 1.63
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*8.40*8.40/6.28 = 361.56
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 361.56/8.40 = 43.03 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/8.40 = 0.75
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.75*0.75*51.90/32.17 = 0.90
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 34.70
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(43.03/34.70) = 1.11
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 1.63/1.11 = 1.47
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 1.47 feet
