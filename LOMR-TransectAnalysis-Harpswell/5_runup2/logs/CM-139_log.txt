    Depth, D = 32.88
    Period, T = 8.88
    Waveheight, H = 3.51
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*8.88*8.88/6.28 = 403.69
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 403.69/8.88 = 45.47 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/8.88 = 0.71
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.71*0.71*32.88/32.17 = 0.51
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 29.75
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(45.47/29.75) = 1.24
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 3.51/1.24 = 2.84
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 2.84 feet
