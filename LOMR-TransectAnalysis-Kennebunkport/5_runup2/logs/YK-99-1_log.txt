    Period, T = 6.75
    Waveheight, H = 1.28
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*6.75*6.75/6.28 = 233.53
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 233.53/6.75 = 34.58 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/6.75 = 0.93
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.93*0.93*10.76/32.17 = 0.29
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 17.71
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(34.58/17.71) = 1.40
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 1.28/1.40 = 0.91
