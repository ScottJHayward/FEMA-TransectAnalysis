Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*10.88*10.88/6.28 = 606.15
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 606.15/10.88 = 55.71 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T

Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.58*0.58*15.56/32.17 = 0.16
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 21.77
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(55.71/21.77) = 1.60
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
