    Period, T = 11.21
    Waveheight, H = 8.98
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*11.21*11.21/6.28 = 643.57
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 643.57/11.21 = 57.41 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/11.21 = 0.56
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.56*0.56*36.55/32.17 = 0.36
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 32.26
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(57.41/32.26) = 1.33
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 8.98/1.33 = 6.74
