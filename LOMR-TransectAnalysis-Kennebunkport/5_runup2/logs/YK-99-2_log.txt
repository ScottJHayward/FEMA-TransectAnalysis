Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*9.87*9.87/6.28 = 499.12
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 499.12/9.87 = 50.56 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/9.87 = 0.64

    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.64*0.64*25.56/32.17 = 0.32
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 27.15
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(50.56/27.15) = 1.36
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
