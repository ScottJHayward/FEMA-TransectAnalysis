Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*10.53*10.53/6.28 = 568.16
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)

    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.60*0.60*11.74/32.17 = 0.13

Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(53.94/19.01) = 1.68
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
