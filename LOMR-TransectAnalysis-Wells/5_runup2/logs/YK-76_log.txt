    Depth, D = 31.40
    Period, T = 11.93
    Waveheight, H = 11.65
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*11.93*11.93/6.28 = 728.24
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 728.24/11.93 = 61.07 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/11.93 = 0.53
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.53*0.53*31.40/32.17 = 0.27
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 30.35
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(61.07/30.35) = 1.42
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 11.65/1.42 = 8.21
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 8.21 feet
