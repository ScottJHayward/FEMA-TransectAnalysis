    Depth, D = 31.88
    Period, T = 12.58
    Waveheight, H = 12.65
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*12.58*12.58/6.28 = 810.38
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 810.38/12.58 = 64.42 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/12.58 = 0.50
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.50*0.50*31.88/32.17 = 0.25
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 30.71
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(64.42/30.71) = 1.45
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 12.65/1.45 = 8.73
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 8.73 feet
