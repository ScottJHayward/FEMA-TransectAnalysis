    Depth, D = 34.03
    Period, T = 11.82
    Waveheight, H = 11.47
Deep water wavelength, L0 (ft)
    L0 = g*T*T/twopi
    L0 = 32.17*11.82*11.82/6.28 = 714.81
Deep water wave celerity, C0 (ft/s)
    C0 = L0/T
    C0 = 714.81/11.82 = 60.50 
Angular frequency, sigma (rad/s)
    sigma = twopi/T 
    sigma = 6.28/11.82 = 0.53
Hunts (1979) approximation for Celerity C1H (ft/s) at Depth D (ft)
    y = sigma.*sigma.*D./g
    y = 0.53*0.53*34.03/32.17 = 0.30
    C1H = sqrt( g.*D./(y+1./(1 + 0.6522.*y + 0.4622.*y.^2 + 0.0864.*y.^4 +0.0675.*y.^5)) )
    C1H = 31.44
Shoaling Coefficient KsH 
    KsH = sqrt(C0/C1H)
    KsH = sqrt(60.50/31.44) = 1.39
Deepwater Wave Height H0_H (ft) 
    H0_H = H/KsH
    H0_H = 11.47/1.39 = 8.27
 
Deepwater mean wave height: 8.27 feet
